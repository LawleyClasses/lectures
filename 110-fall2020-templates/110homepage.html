            <h1>Welcome to the 110 Division of SIGM, Ltd!</h1>
            <p>In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Brown is such a nice color. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown.</p>

            <p>Let that brush dance around there and play. A beautiful little sunset. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. Let the paint work. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. See there how easy that is.</p>

            <p>I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck.</p>
